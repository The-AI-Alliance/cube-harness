# Analyze — XRay Viewer

**Module:** `cube_harness.analyze`

## Purpose

Gradio-based web UI for exploring experiment outputs. Browse agents → tasks → seeds,
step through trajectories, inspect observations (screenshots, AXTree, HTML, reward),
view agent reasoning, and compare runs across experiments.

## Public API

### Entry point
```bash
make xray                          # Makefile target
# or
uv run python -m cube_harness.analyze.xray --results-dir <path>
```

### `XRayState` (dataclass)
Holds all mutable viewer state. Captured by Gradio handler closures. Not a
serializable model — it's UI-only state that lives for the duration of a viewer
session.

Key fields:
- `trajectories: list[Trajectory]` — currently loaded set
- `current_trajectory`, `step` — navigation cursor
- `_storages: list[FileStorage]` — one per loaded experiment dir
- `_traj_storages: list[FileStorage]` — index-aligned with trajectories
- `_exp_tags` — timestamp tag per storage (for disambiguation)
- `_bg_loading_done` / `_bg_gen` — background loading coordination

### `inspect_results` (`cube_harness.analyze.inspect_results`)
CLI-style inspection helpers used by the viewer and exported for ad-hoc scripts.

### `xray_utils` (`cube_harness.analyze.xray_utils`)
Formatting and data-extraction helpers (HTML rendering, trace fragments, step
summaries), plus the **dead-driver detection** the viewer uses to decide whether
orphaned in-flight episodes can be safely swept:

- `_driver_alive(exp_status, exp_dir) -> bool` — mode-aware liveness check.
  - `None` exp_status → True (no `experiment_status.json` → pre-heartbeat
    experiment, assume alive for backward compat).
  - status `COMPLETED` / `INTERRUPTED` → False.
  - status `RUNNING` with fresh experiment heartbeat (within `GHOST_TIMEOUT`) → True.
  - status `RUNNING` with stale experiment heartbeat AND `mode == "sequential"` →
    fall back to per-episode heartbeats (driver may be mid-episode).
- `_promote_ghost_episodes(exp_dir)` — best-effort sweep run on every UI refresh:
  - RUNNING + ray (or no exp_status) → promote when per-episode heartbeat is older
    than `GHOST_TIMEOUT` (`should_sweep_running_to_stale` predicate).
  - RUNNING + sequential + driver_dead → promote immediately (driver IS the
    worker; both dead).
  - QUEUED + driver_dead → promote (no worker will ever pick it up if the
    scheduler is gone). QUEUED is **never** promoted when the driver is alive —
    in a large parallel batch, tasks legitimately wait hours for a slot.

## UI model

A "UI step" is one environment observation paired with the agent action that
follows it. Navigation moves between environment steps. For UI step N:
- Shows the Nth `EnvironmentOutput` (screenshot, axtree, reward, etc.)
- Shows the `AgentOutput` that immediately follows it (actions, LLM call, thoughts)

## Invariants

1. Read-only for *trajectory* data — the viewer never modifies trajectories,
   logs, or configs. The single exception is `_promote_ghost_episodes` writing
   `STALE` into `status.json` files for in-flight episodes whose driver is
   provably dead (see `xray_utils` above). This is gated by
   `experiment_status.json` so the viewer cannot accidentally kill live work.
2. Handles V2 (episodes/) and V1 (jsonl) layouts via `FileStorage`.
3. Background loading: a worker thread populates `trajectories` incrementally;
   stale threads self-abort by comparing `_bg_gen`.
4. Displays `_missing=True` stub trajectories (planned but never ran) distinctly.
5. Injects `_failure_text` from `failure.txt` into metadata when a trajectory has
   no `end_time` — so failed episodes show their stack trace in the UI.

## Gotchas

- Gradio state is per-tab. Closing and reopening the browser resets the view; the
  server keeps running.
- Large trajectories (thousands of steps) are loaded lazily — switching trajectories
  may have noticeable latency on first open.
- The viewer caches step deserialization in-memory per session; very long sessions
  with many open trajectories can grow memory use.
